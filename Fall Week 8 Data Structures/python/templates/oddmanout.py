from collections import defaultdict
# Hint! It might be easier to implement this problem with a defaultdict
# For example, 
# mydict = defaultdict(int)
# This is a map (dict) where if a key is not present, it's "defaults" to 0

qr = int(input())
for tc in range(qr):
    print("Case #{}:".format(tc+1), end=" ") # prints "Case #x "
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    # A now contains the list of all elements
    # Your code here!
    
    pass

    print(ans) # 'ans' should store the answer to the problem here
